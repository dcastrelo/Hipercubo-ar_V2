<h4>Reliability, Performance, Power</h4>

The Drakon has 3:1 gear reduction, fully FDM 3D Printed to keep costs down while performing as well as an extruder at 2-3 times the cost. The Gear ratio means that you’re able to use smaller, lighter motors while keeping the same pushing force as a standard non-geared extruder. For direct drive systems this means a lighter carriage, with less inertial mass, improving print quality. For Bowden systems running a standard sized motor means the Drakon becomes a power house of an extruder with all the power you’ll ever need to get your filament where it needs to go. In both Direct Drive and Bowden configurations you get the reliability and piece of mind to know that it’s not your extruder that’s going to fail.

<h4>Resolution</h4>

By increasing the gearing to 3:1, this triples the resolution, which can mitigate filament being extruded in pulses at slow speeds, which can result in a wavy surface finish, to give you a smooth surface finish. Note: This will not help other mechanical issues such as Z Wobble or Z Banding.

<h4>Materials</h4>

The Drakon has a fully supported filament path, which means it can print anything from flexibles, Carbonfills, metalfills and the hardest of filaments and beyond.

<h4>Universally easy to use</h4>

The Drakon strips down quickly with no need to remove the motor from it’s mounting, loosen the 3 bolts and just remove it from it’s mount. Remove the 8mm nut and bushing and that’s it, highly easy to maintain, should you need to take it apart for any reason. The Tensioner window allows you to easily see and set the tension quickly and precisely with no fuss. Easily mounted on a Direct Drive system as well as a Bowden.
